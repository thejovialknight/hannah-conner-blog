			<h1>a trip to camano island</h1>
		</header>
		<p>Yesterday morning, we set out south on the I5 towards the Stanwood/Camano area. Hannah spent her early childhood there, and we wanted to check out a Norwegian gift shop called Uff Da that she remembered from those days.</p>
			<p>Well, we didn't get any pictures of the shop, and it turns out Hannah's memories were actually of the now defunct dollar store next door, but we aren't here to concern ourselves with the details. Here's some images, starting with the obligatory face-in-hole-billboard-thing.</p>

		<p>As you can see, life still has that magical spark of childhood. In fact, I'm unafraid to admit that the experience of putting one's face through a hole has aged like a fine wine. If you interpret these images chronologically, it's fun to imagine that the threshold of the hole has magical powers that transmogrified Hannah's face into mine!</p>

		<p>I put these together because the minecraft archer lady is actually situated right there under my feet! In this way the reader can start to build a mental map of the environment which the story concerns.</p>
		<p>Taking this further, the first set of images and the next set of images in this post all take place in the same plaza that the above photos were taken in. If you can guess which plaza it is, it's possible you could get a prize.</p>

		<p>We had a lot of fun at the surprisingly rich gift shop. There was a variety of high quality knick knacks, useful kitchen apparel, and art covering the walls. All we have to show for it is an owl and a red hat Hannah tried on. At the gift shop I bought a blue Camano Island hat (non linear! construct a timeline) and Hannah got a nice pair of green stone earrings and almond toffee chocolates.</p>
		<p>We also made sure to stop by Hannah's favorite childhood corner store. It used to have a robust souvenir collection of its own, but it's now only a shadow of its former self.</p>

		<p>Maybe I should have posed in front of the store as well, but that pole I'm leaning against deserves some recognition as well, I think.</p>
		<p>After ditzing around the town some more and driving by Hannah's old house, we came once again to the plaza.</p>

		<p>The cider and stout was excellent, and we had a nice drunken conversation about Plato, Saudi Arabia's The Line, and something to do with sex, as I recall.</p>
		<p>Stanwood and Camano Island are strange. The demographic is fairly old, but not quite so much as I would expect given its reputation as a retirement/tourist destination. The bar we were at almost felt like a hip, liberal Bellingham spot like we're accustomed to, but people seemed more actively willing to interact with us. There's also a perceptible continuity between the culture of the place and some of Hannah's eccentricities, though she hasn't lived here for a decade and a half.</p>
		<p>As we said goodbye to the plaza and headed back towards the freeway, we were given one last piece of advice by the sign overlooking the commons.</p>

		<p>And indeed we were like crabs that day, and it was joyous...</p>
		<p>There was a hell of a lot of crab stuff on that island by the way. That's what they're known for is that they do a lot of crabbing.</p>
